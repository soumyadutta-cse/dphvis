## Workshop Theme

Digital Humanities is a research field that aims to bring new insights to the humanities through scientific techniques centered on computer science and technology. Recently, the digital data handled by Digital Humanities has become more complex and massive, now referred to as cultural big data, which is not only vast but also multimodal, combining image, audio, text, and other types of data.
To extract and utilize information from such complex and diverse big data, it is essential to integrate and further develop various visualization technologies, such as multimodal visualization, massive information visualization, time-series visualization, AI-assisted visualization, noise processing, feature extraction, see-through visualization, immersive visualization, and many others. Additionally, Digital Humanities is, by its nature, an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates the humanities and sciences, with a focus on the convergence of different disciplines.

Based on the above, this workshop aims to provide an opportunity for researchers from various fields, regardless of their background in the humanities or sciences, to gather and exchange ideas. The focus will be on discussing the latest developments in visualization and visual analysis within the context of digital humanities.
