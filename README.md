## Workshop Theme

Digital Humanities is a research field that aims to bring new insights to the humanities through scientific methodologies centered on computer science and technology. In the current era of big data, the digital data handled by Digital Humanities has become more complex, massive, and multi-source.

In this context, a new trend in Digital Humanities has emerged, aiming to involve a broader range of people from various fields in discussions within the humanities through interdisciplinary research utilizing digital technologies. This trend is known as "Digital and Public Humanities (DPH)." In this interdisciplinary fusion, visualization should play an essential role. Therefore, we are launching a new workshop titled "Workshop on Visualization for the Digital and Public Humanities (DPH-Vis)" as part of PacificVis 2025. This workshop is not just a gathering but a platform that fosters new interdisciplinary collaboration. We welcome researchers from various fields, both in scientific and humanities areas.

Visualization for DPH involves a variety of visualizations: high-quality visualization,
feature-highlighting visualization, AI-assisted visualization, immersive visualization, visualization of digital twins, multi-source/multi-dimensional visualization, time-series visualization, story-telling visualization, and many others. We welcome research contributions to any visualization and visual analytics targeting humanities data.

## Participation/Call for Papers

We invite original, unpublished short papers of up to 6 pages including references. Please note that 6 pages is the length limit, not the expected length. Manuscripts should be prepared according to the guide for authors given at [https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).

## Review Process

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by field experts and evaluated based on their relevance to the workshop theme, technical rigor, creativity, originality, and the impact of the methods or results. The workshop will follow a double blind review system.

## Submission Process

To be announced soon

## Publication

We are in touch with IEEE to get approval for the accepted papers to be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

## Timeline/Important Dates
